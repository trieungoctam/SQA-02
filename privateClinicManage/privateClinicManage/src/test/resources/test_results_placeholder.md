# Test Results Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for test result screenshots.

When running the tests, you should capture screenshots of:

1. Test execution results for StatsServiceTest
2. Test execution results for MedicalRegistryListRepositoryTest
3. Code coverage report for the overall project
4. Code coverage report for service.impl package
5. Code coverage report for repository package

Save these screenshots as:
- test_results_stats_service.png
- test_results_mrl_repository.png
- coverage_overall.png
- coverage_service_impl.png
- coverage_repository.png

Place them in the same directory as this file.
