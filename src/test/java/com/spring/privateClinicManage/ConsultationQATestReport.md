# Unit Test Report for Consultation Q&A Functionality

## 1. Introduction

This report documents the unit testing process for the Consultation Q&A functionality in the Private Clinic Management System. The functionality includes viewing/asking questions, providing consultation answers, and liking questions.

## 2. Testing Process

### 2.1 Tools and Libraries Used

The following tools and libraries were used for unit testing:

1. **JUnit 5** - The core testing framework for writing and running tests
2. **Mockito** - For mocking dependencies in unit tests
3. **JaCoCo** - For measuring code coverage
4. **Maven** - For building and running tests
5. **JUnit Platform Suite** - For creating test suites

### 2.2 Components Tested

The following components were tested:

1. **Blog Functionality**
   - `BlogServiceImpl` - Service for managing blogs/questions
   - `LikeBlogServiceImpl` - Service for managing likes on blogs/questions
   - `CommentBlogServiceImpl` - Service for managing comments on blogs/questions

2. **Chat/Consultation Functionality**
   - `ChatRoomServiceImpl` - Service for managing chat rooms between users and consultants
   - `ChatMessageServiceImpl` - Service for managing chat messages in consultations

### 2.3 Components Not Tested and Rationale

The following components were not included in this test suite:

1. **Controllers (API endpoints)**
   - Controllers are better suited for integration tests rather than unit tests
   - They involve HTTP requests and responses which are difficult to test in isolation
   - They will be covered in separate integration tests

2. **Repositories**
   - Repositories are interfaces that extend Spring Data JPA repositories
   - They are automatically implemented by Spring and don't contain custom logic
   - They are indirectly tested through service tests with mocked repositories

3. **Entities**
   - Entities are simple data containers with getters and setters
   - They use Lombok annotations which are well-tested
   - They don't contain complex business logic to test

4. **DTOs**
   - DTOs are simple data transfer objects without business logic
   - They are used for transferring data between layers and don't require unit testing
